# debbie
Configure a Debian / Ubuntu (apt) machine to my liking.

### What's the command I'm looking for?
From a Debian or Ubuntu image:

```
sh <(curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cceckman/debbie/master/debbie.sh)
```

Yes, yes, I should shorten that; but right now cceckman.com doesn't have a cert.
So, yes, I'm being unsafe by piping commands to a shell... but at least it's
through HTTPS.
